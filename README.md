How to build/run a Swift Project in Clion

Reference: http://reitzig.github.io/ramblings/2017/creating-swift-projects-in-clion

Notes:
Before step 7, you must cd into the project folder and "swift build"
That will generate the .build folder needed to put into the run configuration.
Note that every time you wish to run the application after a modification, you must swift build in the console again.
